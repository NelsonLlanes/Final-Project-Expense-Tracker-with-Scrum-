# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## What went well
- Implemented budgets per category with confirm on overâ€‘budget and UI highlight on render
- Charts polished: consistent purple palette, date-sorted line chart, smooth tab transitions
- Category + month filters compose correctly and sync with list and charts

## What could be improved
- Add automation (Cypress smoke + unit tests for grouping/sorting helpers)
- Optimize chart re-render performance under rapid filter changes

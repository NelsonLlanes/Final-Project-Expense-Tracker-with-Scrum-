# Sprint 2 Review

## Done vs Sprint Goal
- Goal: Summaries & Categories
- Completed stories:
  - Edit expense (update persists to LocalStorage and re-renders list)
  - Category filter and monthly view (compose correctly)
  - Summary with basic chart integration (Pie by category, Line by date)
- Partially completed:
  - Chart polish and accessibility moved to Sprint 3 (tab roles/keyboard, animations)

## Demo Notes

- Showed: edit flow (change amount/category/date/note), category + month filters, charts toggle (pie/line)
- Confirmed: line chart labels sorted by date ascending; category totals match filtered list
- Observed: quick re-render on filter toggle; minor flicker to be optimized later

## Product Backlog Updates

- New items:
  - Budget per category with confirm on exceed and UI highlight
  - Accessibility polish for tab UI (ARIA roles, keyboard nav)
  - Performance improvement on chart re-render
- Reprioritized items:
  - Chart visual polish moved to Sprint 3
  - Documentation and final testing planned for Sprint 3
